## Project Overview

This project contains solutions to five cryptography challenges from picoCTF:
1. The Numbers  
2. C3
3. rsa_oracle  
4. HideToSee  
5. interencdec

It includes a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** documenting the techniques used. A **PDF document** is also provided, which contains detailed documentation of the practical solutions and the resolution of the six theoretical exercises.
